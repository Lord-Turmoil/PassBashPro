## What Is It?

PassBashPro, a.k.a. Pash Pro, is a light-weight command-line password manager, using XTEA and MD-5 to protect your data.

Compared to previous version, it not only provides you with management abilities to tidy your passwords, but also presents to you **remote backup** and **sync**. What's more, it now supports multi-user management to allow you create **multiple profiles** on one PC.

## How to Use It?

Just use it like Linux Bash. If you have problems, you can always find help using 'help' command.
