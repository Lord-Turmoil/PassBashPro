## What Is It?

PassBashPro, a.k.a. Pash Pro, is a light-weight command-line password manager, using XTEA and MD-5 to protect your data. It provides you with the following features.

- **Secured** storage with XTEA and MD-5 &mdash; Your password is safe behind the encryption.
- **Command line interface** password management experience &mdash; Ideal tool for geeks.
- User friendly **completion** and editing &mdash; Close to Linux commands.
- **Import and export** your passwords &mdash; Save multiple copies as you wish.
- Remote **backup and sync** using Git &mdash; Never lose contact with your password.
- **Multiple profile** allowed on one device &mdash; For family, our different profiles.
- **Mask** for sensitive data &mdash; Others cannot see your password even behind you.

## How to Use It?

Just use it like Linux Bash. If you have problems, you can always find help using `help` command.

## Notes

Due to some technical reasons, the root directory is `./` instead of `/`. Therefore `./` no longer represents current directory. ☹️
