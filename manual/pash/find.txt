--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alias:
  find, f

Description:
  Find groups or items under specified group using regular expression.

Hint:
  -s  --  Enable strict search. If not set, ".*" will be added between all
          characters for a wider search. Otherwise the expression will not
          be modified.
  -d  --  Enable deep search. If set, the result will also include password
          items if its content matches the expression.

Note:
  If group is not specified, find will be applied under current group. Both
  relative and absolute path is OK.
