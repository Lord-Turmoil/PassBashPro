  set key|value[|weight]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alias:
  set, st

Description:
  Create a new entry, or overwrite current one.

Hint:
  key     --  A string.

  value   --  A string.

  weight  --  A non-negative integer.

Note:
  Entries are sorted ascending by weight. If weight is not specified or is
  negative, it will be generated automatically to the largest.

  In set related commands, '|' is used as a separator between parameters. In
  this way, key and value could contain white space.

Example:
  To create a Username entry, you can use the following command. weight is not
  important, since it will be generated automatically to sort entries by their
  creation time.

  $ set Username|your username
  or
  $ set Username|your username|3
